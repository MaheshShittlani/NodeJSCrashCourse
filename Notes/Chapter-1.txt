What is Node.JS?
--------------------------------------

Frontend (browser)                          Backend(server)
---------------------------------------------------------------
JS                                              Node Allows JS to run on server


How Computers understands code?
------------------------------------------

1. Understand only machine code
2. Assembly Language
3. Programming languages (C, C++)

Programming languages compiled to machine code and executes program.

Js script away from programming language like c++ that is compiled to machine code.

As we know, Js is only run only runs inside browser.

Browser uses, V8 engine(written in c++).

v8 engine compiles javascript into machine code. But we can't run js outside the browser because there is no v8 engine support
outside the browser.

Node js Comes here into picture with a new solution.

Node js also written in C++, which wraps V8 endine.

Node js also includes more features to javascript like
    1. Accessing file system (Read and write files)
    2. Connect with database.
    3. Act as a server for content

Javascript is initially created for client side scripting and creating intractive web with DOM manipulation.

As Node allows it to runs on server and provides some more add on functionality but some client side functionalities
doesn't work on server like DOM Manipulation.
